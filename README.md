## Overview

The Smart Blind Stick is an assistive device designed to improve the mobility and independence of visually impaired individuals. It incorporates ultrasonic sensors and IoT technology to detect obstacles in the user's path and provide real-time feedback through haptic cues. This project was developed at SRM University, India, from June 2019 to October 2019.
